# Rating-view-Xamarin-Android
This app is basically a add on to any app. 

This application has a rating view feature, i.e 5 stars, on clicking on them the ratingValue will be updated. 


## UPDATE
Looks like Android has its own RatingBar tag, I have added that tag view as well with my rating view. 


Do let me know about the issues(if any) would be happy to help! Any pull request and merge are most-welcomed!
